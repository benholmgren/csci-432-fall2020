    \item What was your favorite CS class so far, and why?
    \item What was your least favorite CS class so far, and why?
    \item Why are you interested in taking this course?
    \item What is your biggest academic or research goal for this semester (can
        be related to this course or not)?
    \item What do you want to do after you graduate?

% ============================================
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item I always have a hard time with this. 

	    	\item Probably computational topology, of course. Either that or CS theory.
		I really like a lot of theory, and both of these classes provided that.
		I love to understand the bounds of computation, to design algorithms, 
		and to attempt to conceptualize abstract things. I liked graphics a lot too
		because I felt like I developed a lot as a programmer, but there was too much
		implementation for it to have been explicitly a favorite above the other two.
	    	
		\item I really didn't like the multidisciplinary engineering design course
		that we need to take- if that even counts as a CS class. I ended up
		having to do a lot of wiring and its just not work that I feel like I
		thrive at or enjoy. That class had nothing that I felt was difficult
		to understand or implement, but was still very time consuming, which
		was a recipe for some frustration.
	    	
		\item Because designing algorithms is a ton of fun, and it's something that I
		could definitely enjoy doing as a career. It turns out that there are people who
		work for big tech companies who get paid to do that all day! It also turns out that
		there are people who get paid to do a whole lot of that at a huge number of universities!
		Sounds like the dream!
	
		\item I'd really like to get another publication, and as of tonight Brad and I
		might have another good result to write about that comes from an open problem proposed
		in CCCG by Joe O'Rourke! In particular, I'd really like
		to recieve a publication that is entirely student written, probably with the
		one and only Bradley McCoy. I'm also going to try my best this fall to get a 
		goldwater scholarship, which is another major objective. The list goes on and on
		with this one, so I will refer you to past and future conversations between us for 
		the rest of this answer.
	        
		\item I want to pursue a PhD, hopefully at the University of Washington. This seems like
		a very strong program to me, and the best location for me to attend graduate school
		at this stage in my life and looking towards the future, where I'd hope to have some
		connections and be able to remain in the Pacific Northwest for a while.

		\item The most challenging part of last semester after the transition was definitely missing
		all of the close friends that I get to learn with and do research with every day, especially
		with how extremely difficult the semester was for our group. Those connections mean a lot,
		and especially with the situation that we began all of this in, that was severely missed.
		But I'm more used to the distance now, and have much better figured out how to navigate
		this for myself.
		
		\item I managed my time pretty well. I often work by getting really excited about a subject
		and taking a deep dive in it for an entire day or so. The online transition actually
		allowed for this much better than in person classes, where you are required to be in
		class in person and feel for some reason more obligated to work more incrementally on
		different things, rather than just going huge in one subject area when you feel like it.
